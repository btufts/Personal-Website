Designed models combining knowledge graphs with text-based encoders, achieving a 2.5% higher F1 than baseline. Our research addresses the problem of utilizing a knowledge graph to determine if the answer given to a question is in fact the right answer. We propose three novel methods for retrieving
sub-graphs from Wikidata to perform this task. We gained valuable insight into the attributes of a sub-graph that support generation which can be utilized by future research.
