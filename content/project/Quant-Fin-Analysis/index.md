Quantitative financial analysis analysis of 4 strategies optimized for 10 currency pairs. Achieved multiple profit factors above 1.5 with thorough Monte Carlo, out of sample, and vs. random robustness testing. Authored two reports: backtesting report and robustness report outlining my quantitative analysis process and results.
