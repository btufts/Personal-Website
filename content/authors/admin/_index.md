#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Hi, I’m Brian Tufts – a Machine Learning researcher, AI innovator, and tech enthusiast. Currently pursuing a Master’s in Artificial Intelligence at Carnegie Mellon University and holding a Bachelor’s in Computer Science and Physics from the University of Virginia, I’ve cultivated a strong foundation in ML, reinforcement learning, and large language models. My journey includes impactful research, interesting projects, and internships with leading organizations like Leidos, Amazon Web Services and IBM.

I’m passionate about designing AI-driven systems that tackle real-world challenges, from privacy-enhancing technologies to responsible use of AI. Recently, I’ve been delving into the detectability of large language models and exploring reinforcement learning applications in aviation. Beyond my professional pursuits, you’ll find me spending time outdoors and traveling.

I’m currently seeking full-time opportunities in AI/ML Engineering or Research, where I can collaborate with forward-thinking teams to create impactful solutions.

Let’s connect and build the future together!
